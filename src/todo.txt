need to test properly, code has chaged on cat


need to implement --help on both maybe ???


If -f is combined with -e, ensure you're checking patterns from both sources (command line and file).


If no patterns are provided and -s is not set, you handle the error correctly.
If no files are provided and -s is not set, you handle the error correctly.

However, you should add more robust testing for edge cases, such as:
Providing multiple -e options.
Using -f to read patterns from a file (not currently implemented).



what if doesnt support ANSI ?



Multiple -e options.
#####Empty files or files with only newline characters. 
Combination of multiple flags (e.g., -c, -v, and -l).
Ensure all planned flags (-f, -o) are implemented or explicitly mention their absence in usage.
