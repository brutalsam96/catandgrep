need to test properly, code has chaged on cat
need to implement --help on both maybe ???

### -i on grep is weirding out with multiple files, same with -f




Yes, within the if block for -e, you can include commands or conditions to handle additional functionality related to the -e flag. Here are some ideas for what you can add:

Multiple Patterns:

If multiple patterns are allowed with -e, you could iterate through a list of patterns and check for matches.
Case Insensitive Matching (-i):

Combine -e with -i to perform a case-insensitive search.
Use functions like strcasecmp or convert both the buffer and pattern to lowercase for comparison.
Invert Match (-v):

Check if the -v flag is set, and invert the condition so lines that do not contain the pattern are processed.
Count Matches (-c):

Keep a counter to track the number of lines that match the pattern (or don't match if -v is set).
Line Number Display (-n):

Add logic to print line numbers alongside matching lines.
Highlighting:

If youâ€™re handling highlighting within -e, ensure it is combined properly with other flags.
Quiet Mode (-q):

If -q is implemented, you might exit as soon as the first match is found.
Read Patterns from File (-f):

If -f is combined with -e, ensure you're checking patterns from both sources (command line and file).






If no patterns are provided and -s is not set, you handle the error correctly.
If no files are provided and -s is not set, you handle the error correctly.
However, you should add more robust testing for edge cases, such as:
Providing multiple -e options.
Using -f to read patterns from a file (not currently implemented).



what if doesnt support ANSI ?





Suggested Final Improvements:
Add runtime error checks for memory allocation and ensure cleanup for all error paths.
Provide a --no-color option or a way to disable ANSI escape codes for compatibility.
Test edge cases, such as:
Multiple -e options.
Empty files or files with only newline characters.
Combination of multiple flags (e.g., -c, -v, and -l).
Ensure all planned flags (-f, -o) are implemented or explicitly mention their absence in usage.
